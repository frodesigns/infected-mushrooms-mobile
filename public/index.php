	<h2>Welcome to the Infected Mushrooms guild mobile website!</h2>
	
	<p>
		Infected Mushrooms is a guild which goes back to the old days on the International server in Korea. When Helbreath USA was launched and the International servers went Pay-2-Play, many players from Infected Mushrooms moved to Helbreath USA and started all over again. Not all left in the beginning but within a few months the rest moved as well. We are currently the only guild remaining since the beginning of the Helbreath USA server, and it is our values and friendship that have gotten us this far. If you have any unanswered questions about Infected Mushrooms after browsing this website, feel free to ask any of us in-game or on our <a href="/public/pubforum-public.php">Public Forum</a>. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Want to join us?</h2>
	
	<p>
		Players who wish to join the guild may post on our forum with information about themselves and their characters. Remember to go to the <a href="/public/rules.php">Rules</a> section and check to see if you will be able to obey them. We generally recruit 1-3 new recruits every three months. In certain cases, the guild will take a break from recruiting. The periods for when we stop and start recruiting will be announced in the <a href="/public/pubforum-public.php">Public Forum</a>. We want you to feel comfortable and welcome in whatever guild you join, so if you do sign up for Infected Mushrooms - please try and get to know our members first.

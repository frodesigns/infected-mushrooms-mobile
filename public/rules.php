	<h3 class='titlehdr'>Guild Guidelines</h3>
	<strong><u>Hunts - Definition</u></strong><br />
	A guild hunt is a hunt that has only IM members in it, with the exeptions of ppl who wants to join the hunt and are not from the guild who come only to enjoy the company and the fun. The hunt has to be at least 5 members to consider it a guild hunt (unless the people agree to make the drops a guild item even if they are less then five). 
	<br /><br />
	<strong><u>Hunts - Gathering Loot</u></strong><br />
	We do trust each other in the guild, but to a certain extent. Do not bow down on bodies, unless you see a drop. When the drop has been picked up, announce it to the others who are on the hunt or in the guildchat. People can easily get suspicious if you keep bowing down on bodies and says nothing.
	<br /><br />
	A "bank" will usually be announced in the beginning of the hunt. A bank is a member who picks up all the gold that was dropped by the monsters. Its up to members if they want their share to go to the guild treasury or into their own bag. 
	<br /><br />
	<strong><u>Hunts - Splitting Loot</u></strong><br />
	If a foodgames is played within the guild, only those who can and will use the item signs up for that specific item. Warriors do not sign up for mage items and mages do not sign up for warrior items. It does not matter if you have a secondary character who is another class - primary characters first.
	<br /><br />
	Do not trade items gained through guildhunts. If you dont have any use of the item anymore, donate it to the guild. This helps those who are not as fortunate as yourself and will in the long run help the guild as a whole. 
	<br /><br />
	<strong><u>Guilditems - Treatment</u></strong><br />
	Always wear at least 2 Zemstones in your bag, while using a guilditem - no exceptions. Never drop a guilditem on the ground or pass it to someone in a place which is not a safezone. When you recieve a guilditem, log out and back in again to save the item in the database. Never lend guilditems out to players who are not members of the guild. Members who have joined the guild recently should not borrow guilditems. You will have to wait for a little while. Guilditems should not be kept for too long (eg. 5+ hours), as others might want to use them. When you're finished with a guilditem, do not log off with it - repair the item and return it to Bantam or to another online member (who is not afk).
	<br /><br />
	Warriors should not be using the mage items (eg. MS30) and mages should not be using warrior items (eg. Ice Elemental Necklace). Its not fun knowing that a member of the other class is using an item that is little use to their class and much more useful to your class. 
	<br /><br />
	<strong><u>Guilditems - Leeching</u></strong><br />
	This may sound pretty harsh, but members should take it easy on the guilditems if they dont participate in the guildhunts themselves. A member may want to do other things, but it doesnt hurt to help out the guild once in a while. If you want to use the guilditems you should help the guild in gaining them. It doesnt matter if the guild doesnt find any items on the hunts you have been on - you helped and thats what counts.
	<br /><br />
	Do not ask members if you can borrow their personal items. If people want to be generous, they will usually be the ones asking if any members wants to borrow their items. Also, treat members items as you would treat a guilditem (2 zems, relog to save, etc). 
	<br /><br />
	<strong><u>Member Behaviour - Aresdens</u></strong><br />
	Going peace with Aresden players is not recommended. Although they may be friends of yours, you should still be able to attack and kill them if neccesary. The same is expected from them. Peace will not only make it difficult for guild raids, but also make a lot of trouble if members of the guild are being attacked and you do not take action against the Aresdens. 
	<br /><br />
	<strong><u>Member Behaviour - Elvines</u></strong><br />
	Do not bother people outside the warehouse or any other place unless you have a reason. Many of us do not want random people hitting us, so do not do this to others. The same goes for traveller characters - do not bother them, unless you are absolutely sure that it is a spy character.
	<br /><br />
	Do not steal drops or experience from other players, unless its someone who deserves it. We have all had it done towards us and those who dared doing it were punished. 
	<br /><br />
	<strong><u>Member Behaviour - Chat</u></strong><br />
	Try your best to interact in the guildchat. Say "Hello" when you log on and "Goodbye" when you log back off again. If someone is having a conversation in the guildchat, dont be shy to talk with them - if its a private conversation, they would probably have kept it in "whisper".
	<br /><br />
	Keep the language in the guildchat in English. It doesnt matter if its only people from your own country who seem to be online. 
	<br /><br />
	Watch your language. The guild is supposed to be a union of players who work together and enjoy each others presence. You may speak freely and voice your opinion on subjects, but hostility against members is not appreciated. Keep in mind that the majority of the guild are adults, though some are not. Keep the swearing at a minimum, if you need to let out your anger or frustration. 
	<br /><br />
	<strong><u>Recruits - Polls</u></strong><br />
	A recruit will recieve membership by gaining at least 80% Positive Votes on the poll. If the recruit gets more than 20% Negative Votes, the recruit will be removed from the list. 
	<br /><br />
	<strong><u>Recruits - IRL</u></strong><br />
	Reallife friends/family are able to join the guild. These will have the same status as any other new recruit, but they do not have to go through the polls. Keep in mind that the same rules apply for these as any other member/recruit. This means no sharing of their account. If they fail to obey the rules, they will as anyone else either recieve a warning or be kicked from the guild. 
	<br /><br />
	<strong><u>Game Rules</u></strong><br />
	Players represent not only themselves, but the guild as a whole when they have the "Infected Mushrooms Guildsman" tag under their name. Every single member of the guild is expected to follow the guidelines and rules set up by IEntertainment.
